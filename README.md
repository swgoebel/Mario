Super Mario Bros demo

This is a demo featuring the first level of Super Mario Bros. from NES.

It uses the framework found at http://www.kilobolt.com/unit-4-android-game-development.html

I added the following
  State changes for the player. Commonly seen when Mario collects a mushroom.
  A timer, that if expires, kills the player
  Sprites and maps seen in Super Mario Bros. These where edited with Paint.net using sprite sheets
  A score is now kept for the user. This is increased by collecting coins and disposing of enemies.
  Sounds and music for various actions and scenarios like jumping, dying, collecting coins.
